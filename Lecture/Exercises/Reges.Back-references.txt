You can reuse the same backreference more than once. ([a-c])x\1x\1 matches axaxa, bxbxb and cxcxc.

Most regex flavors support up to 99 capturing groups and double-digit backreferences. 
So \99 is a valid backreference if your regex has 99 capturing groups.

every span of text captured by () is given an internal number
you can use \number to use the captured text in the replacement
\0 is the overall pattern
\1 is the first parenthetical capture
...
Back-references can also be used in egrep pattern matching
Match “A” surrounded by the same character: “(.)A\1”
Match “A-Z” surrounded by the same character: "(.)[A-Z]\1"
